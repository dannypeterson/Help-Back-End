##### **_Getting Started_**

###### Upon visiting Help! individuals can become users by creating and logging in to a user authenticated account. Once logged in to Help! users can write reviews on tasty dishes they've experienced from a select list of local restaurants. Users can then navigate to their profile page to see a collection of their own dish reviews. By visiting the feed page, users can see a compilation of reviews created by all users, from most recent to least recent.
